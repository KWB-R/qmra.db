1,"Conventional clarification","Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation","Depends on coagulation conditions"
2,"Dissolved air flotation","Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation","Depends on coagulant dose"
3,"High-rate clarification","Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation","Depends on use of appropriate
blanket polymer"
4,"Lime softening","Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation","Depends on pH and settling time"
5,"Granular high-rate filtration","Filtration","Depends on filter media and coagulation pretreatment; filtered water turbidity of ? 0.3 NTU in 95% of
samples (and none to exceed 1 NTU)
associated with 1–2 log reduction
of viruses and 3 log reduction of
Cryptosporidiuma"
7,"Precoat filtration","Filtration","If filter cake is present. Depends on chemical pretreatment,  media grade and filtration
rate"
8,"Slow sand filtration","Filtration","Depends on presence of schmutzdecke, grain size, flow rate, operating conditions (mainly temperature, pH); filtered water turbidity of ? 1NTU in 95% of samples (and none to exceed 5 NTU)
associated with 1–2 log reduction of viruses and 2.5–3 log reduction of Cryptosporidiuma"
9,"Bank filtration","Pretreatment","Depends on travel distance, soil type,
pumping rate, pH, ionic strength"
10,"Roughing filters","Pretreatment","Depends on filter medium, coagulant"
11,"Storage reservoirs","Pretreatment","Residence time > 40 days (bacteria), 160 days (protozoa)"
12,"Chlorine","Primary disinfection","Free chlorine × contact time predicts efficacy; not effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts. Turbidity and chlorine-demanding solutes inhibit this process; hence, turbidity should be kept below 1 NTU to support
effective disinfection. Where this is not practical, turbidities should be kept below 5 NTU with higher chlorine doses or contact times. In addition to initial disinfection, the benefits of maintaining free chlorine residuals throughout distribution systems at or above 0.2 mg/l should be considered"
13,"Chlorine dioxide","Primary disinfection",NA
14,"Ozonation, drinking water","Primary disinfection","Viruses generally more resistant than bacteria. Protozoa: depends on temperature;
Cryptosporidium varies widely"
15,"UV disinfection, drinking water","Primary disinfection","Effectiveness of disinfection depends on delivered fluence (dose), which varies with intensity, exposure time and UV wavelength. Excessive turbidity and certain dissolved species inhibit this process; hence, turbidity should be kept below 1 NTU to support effective disinfection. Where this is not practical, turbidities should be kept below 5 NTU with higher fluences"
